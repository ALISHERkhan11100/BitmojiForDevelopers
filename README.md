## Notice for Existing Developers Using Bitlinks 
_Going forward, Snap will no longer be supporting Bitlinks on our platform. This product documentation has been formally removed for some time, but we understand this may be disruptive to your business, so we want to provide an alternative option. Fortunately, Bitmoji services are still available to developers through this link: https://github.com/Bitmoji/BitmojiForDevelopers/blob/main/docs/stickers_snapkit.md._
